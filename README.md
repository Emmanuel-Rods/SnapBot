# SnapBot v2

SnapBot is a modern, browser-level automation library designed specifically for Snapchat.
Built on top of Puppeteer, SnapBot enables developers to create powerful Snapchat bots without relying on internal APIs or reverse engineering — all through the familiar browser environment.

Whether you're automating daily snaps, managing multiple accounts, or building complex chat workflows, SnapBot abstracts the hard parts so you can focus on what matters: the logic and creativity behind your automation.

## 💼 Use Cases
* Daily content distribution via snaps
* Streak automation for agencies or influencers
* CRM-style customer engagement bots
* AI-integrated messaging workflows
* Custom Snapchat tools for businesses

## 🚀 Features

* **Image Uploads**: Send images directly through the bot.
* **Full Chat Automation**: Automate sending and receiving messages.
* **Snap Shortcuts**: Quickly send snaps to predefined contacts.
* **Smart Notification Blocking**: Prevent unwanted notifications during automation.
* **Advanced Contact Handling**: Manage contacts efficiently within the bot.
* **Multiple Account Support**: Handle multiple Snapchat accounts simultaneously.
* **Custom Captions**: Send snaps with personalized captions.
* **Snapstreak Maintenance**: Ensure your streaks never break again.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Emmanuel-Rods/SnapBot
   ```



2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd SnapBot
   ```



3. **Install the necessary dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```



4. **Set up environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```



Edit the `.env` file and add your Snapchat credentials:

```env
USER_NAME=<Your Snapchat Username>
USER_PASSWORD=<Your Snapchat Password>
```



## 🛠️ Usage

To run the bot, use the following command:

```bash
npm run bot
```



This command will start SnapBot, logging into Snapchat, capturing a snap, and sending it to your specified contacts.

If you run into a CAPTCHA when using SnapBot, see this guide for a solution:

### 🧩 Stability Notice

SnapBot relies heavily on DOM selectors, which means updates to the Snapchat web interface can occasionally break its functionality.

I’m actively working on an auto-update system to detect and adapt to these changes — and **your help is welcome**!

* 💬 Open an issue
* 🛠️ Submit a pull request
* ✉️ Reach out at [alewsor@gmail.com](mailto:alewsor@gmail.com)

Together we can make SnapBot more stable and smarter. 🧠✨
