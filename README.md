# SnapBot v2

SnapBot is a modern, browser-level automation library designed specifically for Snapchat.
Built on top of Puppeteer, SnapBot enables developers to create powerful Snapchat bots without relying on internal APIs or reverse engineering — all through the familiar browser environment.

Whether you're automating daily snaps, managing multiple accounts, or building complex chat workflows, SnapBot abstracts the hard parts so you can focus on what matters: the logic and creativity behind your automation.

## 💼 Use Cases
* Daily content distribution via snaps
* Streak automation for agencies or influencers
* CRM-style customer engagement bots
* AI-integrated messaging workflows
* Custom Snapchat tools for businesses

## 🚀 Features

* **Image Uploads**: Send images directly through the bot.
* **Full Chat Automation**: Automate sending and receiving messages.
* **Snap Shortcuts**: Quickly send snaps to predefined contacts.
* **Smart Notification Blocking**: Prevent unwanted notifications during automation.
* **Advanced Contact Handling**: Manage contacts efficiently within the bot.
* **Multiple Account Support**: Handle multiple Snapchat accounts simultaneously.
* **Custom Captions**: Send snaps with personalized captions.
* **Snapstreak Maintenance**: Ensure your streaks never break again.

### 🧩 Stability Notice

SnapBot relies heavily on DOM selectors, which means updates to the Snapchat web interface can occasionally break its functionality.

I’m actively working on an auto-update system to detect and adapt to these changes — and **your help is welcome**!

* ✉️ Reach out at [alewsor@gmail.com](mailto:alewsor@gmail.com)

Together we can make SnapBot more stable and smarter. 🧠✨
